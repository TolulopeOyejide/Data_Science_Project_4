# Movie Recommendation System

In this project, I create a movie recommendation system using jupyter, python and pandas. At the end, you will be able to type the name of a movie and get recommendations for other movies you might like.


### Project Steps
- Start with the MovieLens 25M dataset, which contains movie reviews and ratings.
- Build a search engine to find a specific movie title in the data.
- Create a recommendation engine to recommend specific movies.



## Code
You can find the code for this project here.

File overview:
- `Movie Recommendation System.ipynb` - a jupyter notebook that contains all of the code.



## Data
- I download all of the data during the project, from [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbGp5Nk5sQUN3RXBLUE5COFRVSTJFalNEaHduUXxBQ3Jtc0trOTNQOGtZdzhldEEtSXpJOUNrUm05T0Q2WUZOd0djZ1JZQmUzX1J2VlllRzQ4U2FGOXd0LXU4dld3TDlXQk9qRFVnTlEtdjlpOVZEOWJQNjVaUFdvV2g5SEpVNGVvaVUzSnRENDJFY3haNDBUNTltZw&q=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.grouplens.org%2Fdatasets%2Fmovielens%2Fml-25m.zip&v=eyEabQRBMQA)
