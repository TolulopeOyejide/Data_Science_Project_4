# Movie Recommendation System

In this project, I create a movie recommendation system using jupyter, python and pandas. At the end, you will be able to type the name of a movie and get recommendations for other movies you might like.


### Project Steps
- Start with the MovieLens 25M dataset, which contains movie reviews and ratings.
- Build a search engine to find a specific movie title in the data.
- Create a recommendation engine to recommend specific movies.



## Code
You can find the code for this project here.

File overview:
- `Movie Recommendation System.ipynb` - a jupyter notebook that contains all of the code.



## Data
- I download all of the data during the project, from [here](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/rating-disposition-2023/)
